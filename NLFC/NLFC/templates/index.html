          <p>My Awesome Cart Private Limited, d/b/a My Awesome Cart is an Indian e-commerce company based in Bengaluru, India. It was founded by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal in 2007. The company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials & groceries, and lifestyle products.

                  The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March 2017, My Awesome Cart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] My Awesome Cart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8] My Awesome Cart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
                  
                  In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in My Awesome Cart for US$16 billion, valuing it at $20 billion.</p>
